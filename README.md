# CodeLab I
CodeLab I - CCO4000-20 Module Materials

## Module Overview

CodeLab I is a rapid prototyping workshop series that introduces the fundamentals of procedural programming. You encounter the first principles of coding from computational thinking and maths for programmers to key elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays and functions.

We assume little to no prior experience of coding on entry. You learn procedural programming from the ground up, working through coding challenges and creative briefs that help embed new techniques and best practice into your programming ‘toolkit’.

The module has two themes: Logic and C++.

#### Logic

A primer in algorithmic thinking. You solve logic problems, tackle mathematical challenges common in programming and design basic algorithms. This section is designed to slow down your thinking so you can break down problems into discrete solvable steps.

#### C++

An introduction to the core concepts of programming. You build simple applications that support your understanding of the following topics:

* Data types (int, float, double, boolean, char, string)
* Basic user interactivity
* Operators
* Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
* Control flow statements (while, do-while, for)
* Arrays
* Functions (passing in, returning out)

## Repository Contents

### Chapters

These folders contains the chapters of CodeLab Programming Fundamentals workbook. These chapters should be used in combination with weekly session materials provided on Minerva for full information on everything covered through CodeLab. The chapters and content are ordered in line with the classroom content allowing you to follow along before putting what you’ve learned into practice with the exercises.

### Chapter Exercises

Each workbook chapter includes exercises to put into practice the techniques you have learned. You should aim to complete these exercises in order as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises. Exercises with a tickmark  represent exercises that must be submitted as part of the Programming Skills Portfolio assessment as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks.

To complete the exercises:

* First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine
* Create a **separate project** for each exercise in the corresponsing chapter's exercise folder
* When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github

*Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio / Xcode project files. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.*

### Further Exercises

This folder contains additional exercises that should be used if you are looking for some tougher challenges beyond those included in the chapter exercises. These can be submitted as part of your skills portfolio, but you should ensure you have completed the required exercises from each chapter first.

### Guides

Guides on cloning this repository to your machine via GitHub desktop are provided in the guides folder, alongside general information on creating a project in Visual Studio and Xcode.
